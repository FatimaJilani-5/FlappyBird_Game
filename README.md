# 🐦 Flappy Bird – C++ OOP Edition (SFML)

A fun recreation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **C++**, powered by the **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

In this game, you control a bird that must flap its way through a series of pipes without hitting them. It features smooth gameplay, accurate collision detection, and modular code design using C++ classes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🕹️ Player-controlled bird physics
- 🧱 Pipe generation with dynamic gaps
- 💥 Collision detection and restart system
- 🧠 Clean OOP design using classes: `Bird`, `Pipe`, `Game`
- 🎨 Textures, fonts, and smooth animations using SFML
- 🧮 Score system with live UI display

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Principle         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Each entity (`Bird`, `Pipe`, `Game`) manages its own state and behavior |
| **Abstraction**   | Internal logic like movement, flapping, and collisions are abstracted into classes |
| **Modularity**    | Classes are organized in separate files for readability and scalability |
| **Reusability**   | Texture loading, movement logic, and collision checks are reusable across game objects |
